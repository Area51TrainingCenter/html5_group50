			<section>
				<p>In an interview with Auto Express, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said the name for the Model 3 stemmed back to a legal entanglement with Ford, which threatened to sue Tesla over a trademark for "Model E."</p>
				<p>"We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E â€” I thought this is crazy, Ford's trying to kill sex! So we'll have to think of another name," Musk said. "The new model is going to be called Model III, we'll have three bars to represent it and it'll be S III X!"</p>
				<p>The Model 3's reported range would be less than the Model S, which is rated for 306 miles when equipped with the 85-kWh battery. By comparison, the Roadster (Tesla's first car) is rated for 245 miles per charge, and weighed nearly 2,000 pounds less.</p>
