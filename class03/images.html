				<p>In an interview with <em>Auto Express</em>, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said the name for the Model 3 stemmed back to a legal entanglement with Ford, which threatened to sue Tesla over a trademark for <em>"Model E."</em></p>
				<p>"We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E — <strong>I thought this is crazy, Ford's trying to kill sex!</strong> So we'll have to think of another name," Musk said. "The new model is going to be called Model III, we'll have three bars to represent it and it'll be S III X!"</p>
				<p>The Model 3's reported range would be less than the Model S, which is rated for 306 miles when equipped with the 85-kWh battery. By comparison, the Roadster (Tesla's first car) is rated for 245 miles per charge, and weighed nearly 2,000 pounds less.</p>
